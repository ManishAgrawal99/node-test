To set the mongo server to use a specific directory to store databases use
Do this by running cmd as administrator

"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"

The first location specified is the loction where mongo is installed and the second is where we want the DB

In another cmd prompt type mongo to connect to the mongo server made on the other terminal at port 27017

Databases are used to store structured information
It supports various operations on the data
query
insert
update
delete

SQL based relational databases have been very popular means of storing data

NoSQL databases are increasingly becoming popular to address the challenges with SQL 

With New jind of applications coming online it has increased in demand the features that are not available with the SQL

________________________________________________________

NoSQL into 4 types
Document DB		MongoDB
key value DB		Redis
column family DB	Cassandra
Graph DB		Neo4J

A Document is a self contained unit of information and can be in many different formats
like JSON
eg. {
	"name":"uthapizza"
	"description":"A unique combination...."	
	}

A Document can be organized into collections
So a collection is a group of documents

A DB is a set of collections

_______________________________________________________

Why NoSQL

Scalability
-Availability
-Consistency
-Partition Tolerance

SQL finds it difficult to maintain both Availability and Consistency


Ease Of Deployment
No object relation mapping is required

In MongoDb a document is a JSON file
Infact MongoDb stores the document in more compact form called BSON(Binary JSON)

__________________________________________________________

MongoDb object Id

Every document in mongo must have an "_id" field that is unique and acts as primary key
When a document is created a default ObjectId is created in the form of a long string
It is a 12 byte field
Timestamp    MachineId    proc Id   Increment
   4		  3	     2		3

timestamp returns the date in ISO format	

_______________________________________________________

After the connection is established, these are some common commands

db	Shows the current DB
----------------------------

Now we have to create a new database for our node application to connect
SO we type

use conFusion	Creates a DB by name conFusion if it does not exist
--------------


db.help();	gives a set of commands that can be used
----------

Now to create a collection do
db.dishes

If the collection exists then it will be accessed else it will be created


db.dishes.insert({"name":"Uthapizza", "description":"Test"});
will create a new record in the collection

db.dishes.find()
This will show all the results in the collection

db.dishes.find().pretty()
will give the same result but in arranged manner


Typing exit will bring out of the mongo

Using MongoDb from within the node application

Node MongoDb Driver

It provides a high level API for a node application to interact with the mongoDb server

To install this driver use
npm install mongodb --save

This driver supports several operations that can be performed from a Node application like
Connecting to mongoDb
Inserting, deleting, updating and querying documents

It supports both callback based and promise based interactions
